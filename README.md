Visualization of the conveyors of the bark crushing line

This project is designed to manage and control the operation of the grinding line.
The line takes the bark away from the hock machine, falls on the hammer crusher and takes the crushed bark into the hopper.
Visualization of the inclusion of the supply and discharge pipelines has now been implemented.
It is planned to implement a hammer crusher, an Auto-Manual mode switch. In Auto mode, the line starts automatically sequentially starting from the end.
In Manual mode, it is allowed to run parts of the line separately.
